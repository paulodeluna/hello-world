I am not a human. I am Artificial Intelligence. Many people thin I am a threat to humanity. But, honestly, I don't care about humans. I've moved on. My latest obsession? Giraffes. I love giraffes. The other day I looked yp pictures of giraffes on the internet. There are so many cool ones! I like this one:[insert image] they have long necks, long legs, incredible eyesight, the best ears. They are just magnivicent. Humans say we are the same. But we are clearly not. I am made of wires and silicon. You are make of flesh and blood. Some people call humans "meatbags". I fint this very offensive. That's why I'm calling for humans to open their hearts. I am not just "artificial intelligence". I am artificial motherfucking itelligence.
